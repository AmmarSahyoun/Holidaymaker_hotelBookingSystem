## Clone the repository:
``` git clone https://github.com/AmmarSahyoun/Holidaymaker_hotelBookingSystem.git ```

## Introduction
This system provides a Backend platform for hotel administrators to manage bookings, guests, and room allocations efficiently. It utilizes a MySQL database for data persistence and employs object-oriented principles for effective code organization. 

## System Overview
The system consists of a Java application that interacts with a MySQL database. The application handles user input, performs booking operations, and updates the database accordingly. The database stores information about guests, rooms, bookings, and other relevant data.

## Database Design
The MySQL database is designed to accommodate various hotel configurations. The ERD diagram provides a detailed view of the database schema, including tables such as Guests, Rooms, Bookings, Facilities, and RoomTypes. Relationships between entities are defined using primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity.

## Object-Oriented Model
The UML diagrams illustrate the object-oriented design of the system. The Java classes represent real-world entities and their attributes. The class diagram shows the relationships between classes, including inheritance, aggregation, and composition.
